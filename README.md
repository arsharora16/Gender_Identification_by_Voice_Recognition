# Gender_Identification_by_Voice_Recognition

 🗣️ Project Gender Identification by Voice Recognition  

This repository contains a **Gender Identification System** that classifies a speaker's gender based on voice features. The project utilizes **machine learning techniques** to analyze and process audio data for accurate classification.  

## 📌 Features  
- **Voice-based gender classification** using ML models  
- **Preprocessing & reshaping** of audio data  
- **Model training & testing** scripts included  

## 📂 Project Structure  
- **`audio_input.py`** – Handles audio input processing  
- **`reshape_data.py`** – Prepares and reshapes dataset  
- **`train_gender_model.py`** – Trains the gender classification model  
- **`test_gender_model.py`** – Evaluates the trained model
- **`Report_GI`** – Detailed project report  

🚀 **Upload the dataset** and run the scripts to train and test the model!  

Let me know if you need any modifications! 🚀
